## Background

Each team member must be cognizant of threat actors, i.e., entities or individuals that conduct malicious cyber activities, e.g.,

* Exploit vulnerabilities, e.g., <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/23/1036140/2021-record-zero-day-hacks-reasons/" target="_blank">zero-day</a> vulnerabilities.
* Data theft via unauthorised access to computing assets.
* Intentional disabling or destruction of computing assets, or disruption of services.

The actors have varying <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/cybersecurity-explained/threat-actors#:~:text=are%20Threat%20Actors%E2%80%99-,Motivations,-%3F" target="_blank">motivations</a>. Threat actors will exploit unprotected or insufficiently secured attack surfaces.

Potential threat actors are listed below. Presently, the most probable threat actor is an insider. However, as the team **(a)** grows, **(b)** starts delivering products & services, and **\(c\)** engages with a wider range of internal & external entities â€“ the threat likelihood per actor increases. [Intellectual property theft, data theft, etc., by external entities will become much more probable.]

* Insiders, i.e., employees or contractors.
* Cyber criminals.
* Hackers.
* State actors

## Protection

The [Cyber Security Body of Knowledge](https://www.cybok.org/knowledgebase1_1/) is a helpful cyber security reference text.  Practically, the team will be guided by the <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/cybersecurity-explained/threat-actors#:~:text=Protection%20Methods%20and-,Strategies,-Maintaining%20strict%20cyber">SOPHOS</a> protection proposals, e.g.,

Privileges will be set, and withdrawn, via IAM (Identity & Access Management) roles, and trust policies thereof. Mandatory multi-factor authentication for cloud tools, e.g., Amazon Web Services, GitHub, etc.<br></dd>
